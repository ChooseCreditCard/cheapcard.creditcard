          Low-fee cards can be great for budgeting, students, travellers or anyone who wants simple, predictable
          pricing. But “cheap” can mean many different things: low annual fee, low FX fees, low APR or minimal extras.
          This page breaks it down in neutral, clear language.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What People Mean by a “Cheap” Credit Card</h2>
      <p>
        A credit card can be “cheap” in different ways depending on your spending habits. Some users care about
        <strong>no annual fee</strong>, while others focus on <strong>0% FX fees</strong>, low interest rates,
        or simply avoiding unexpected charges.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most low-fee cards are simple by design. They may not include premium perks like lounges or travel insurance,
        but they keep costs down — which is what many people want.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this site is to explain each cost component so you can decide what “cheap” means for your own usage.

    <!-- Fees -->
    <section id="fees" class="section">
      <h2>Common Fees That Influence a Card’s Cost</h2>
      <p>Here are the main factors that determine how cheap or expensive a card really is:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Annual fee:</strong> The simplest indicator of cheapness. Many cards offer €0 annual fee.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>FX fees:</strong> If you travel, a card with low or 0% foreign transaction fees may be the
          “cheapest” even if it has a small annual fee.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cash withdrawal fees:</strong> Some low-fee cards charge extra for ATM use, so read the fine print.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Late fees:</strong> Even a free card becomes expensive if you miss payments.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>APR / interest:</strong> The cost of carrying a balance. If you pay in full each month,
          this may not matter — but for others it’s the biggest cost.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        A card is only truly cheap if it matches <strong>your</strong> spending pattern. A €0 annual fee is not
        enough if FX or ATM fees make the card expensive to use abroad.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Trade-offs -->
    <section id="risks" class="section">
      <h2>What You Give Up With Cheaper Cards</h2>
      <p>
        Cheaper cards often remove premium perks so they can keep costs low. This can include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>No airport lounge access</li>
        <li>No travel insurance</li>
        <li>Limited rewards or no rewards</li>
        <li>Lower credit limits</li>
        <li>Fewer advanced features (virtual cards, budgeting tools, etc.)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These trade-offs aren’t necessarily bad — many users just want predictable, simple billing with minimal fees.
